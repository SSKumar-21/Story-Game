"Watching from the window, I saw so many stars.",
"Mom, Dad, I miss you so much",
"I remembered that car accident. Now, when I think of it, I feel it's my fault.",
"I promise, Mom and Dad, I will take care of my little sister and make all of you proud.",
"A cold breeze of air entered my room, wiping my tears.",
"A photo frame fell.",
"Oh, that's the photo of my soccer team. We won the cup. What a great win it was! We won 2-1",
"I put the photo back and lie down on my bed, in hopes that I will get admission to the cheap university...",
"So I could not be a burden on my uncle. After Mom and Dad, he was the only one because of whom my sister and I are able to live.",and
"Thinking of these things, I don't know when I fell into a deep sleep"
